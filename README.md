# Design Patterns Implementation
This project demonstrates two fundamental design patterns: Modified Singleton Pattern and Abstract Factory Pattern. Each implementation showcases different aspects of object-oriented design principles and pattern usage.

# Part 1: Modified Singleton Pattern
An exploration of a modified Singleton pattern that manages exactly three instances instead of the traditional single instance approach. The project implements two variations of this pattern to demonstrate different initialization strategies.

# Lazy Singleton
  * Concept: Instances are created only when first requested
  * Key Features: * On-demand instance creation
                  * Thread-safety management
                  * Delayed resource allocation
                  * Instance tracking mechanism
# Eager Singleton
  * Concept: All instances are created during class initialization
  * Key Features: * Immediate instance availability
                  * Inherent thread safety
                  * Predictable memory usage
                  * No synchronization overhead
